Subject: **PhoneNow Customer Retention Dashboard Findings and Recommendations - Please Review**

Dear [Name],

I am writing to you today to explain my findings and provide suggestions for necessary changes based on the Customer Retention dashboard I have created for PhoneNow.

**Key Findings**

- The overall churn rate for PhoneNow is 26.54%, which is slightly above the industry average.
- The churn rate is highest for customers with contracts less than one year (48.28%) and customers on month-to-month contracts (42.71%).
- The churn rate is also high for customers who use fiber optic internet service (41.89%) and pay by electronic check (45.29%).
- The churn rate is highest among customers who have opened customer support tickets in the technical category.
- The average customer lifetime value (CLV) for PhoneNow is $73,910.

**Suggestions**

- PhoneNow should offer more competitive prices and plans for contracts less than one year, month-to-month contracts, and fiber optic internet service.
- PhoneNow should also offer incentives for customers to pay by methods other than electronic check.
- PhoneNow should invest in improving customer service, especially for customers who are at risk of churning.
- PhoneNow should invest in training for the customer support team so that they can better resolve technical issues.
- PhoneNow should focus its retention efforts on customers with the highest CLVs, especially customers on month-to-month contracts, contracts lasting 2-4 years, and using fiber optic internet service.

**Next Steps**

I recommend that we meet with PhoneNow to discuss these findings and suggestions in more detail. I am also happy to create additional dashboards or reports to help PhoneNow understand their churn data and identify specific areas for improvement.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Uyen Tran.
